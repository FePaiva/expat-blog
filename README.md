Expat Blog

This is phase-2 of my idea in helping migrants coming to the US.

Phase-1: Chat app where users can join rooms to discuss / share experience about topics related to migration.
Phase-2: Blog app where users can find relevant information shared by other users about their experience as a migrant.
Phase-3: Website hosting the Chat and Blog apps, also containing information about immigration and tax legislation, consulates information, where to find support, and other things based on trend topics from the blog and chat.
